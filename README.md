# Morphological-Filtering-of-Point-Clouds

> A test for the morphological filter during my LiDAR course.

`terrain.txt` is the whole point cloud test data.

`dixingpo.txt` is a filtered point cloud. It's filtered through 2.5D raster method with a resolution of 0.02m.

- use the data preprocess notebook to preprocess the data and get `test.txt`.

- use CSF filter to be a comparison.

- `filter.cpp` is my morphological filter of point clouds.
